# Job Days Left

This project takes an input date for an end date and counts the number of business days between
the current day and the given end date. It then displays informational and possibly inspiring
descriptions describing that duration of time.

This was inspired by my wife starting a new job and I would count how many days were left each
morning before we would leave. This site will be far faster and more accurate at counting days
and will have more varied responses than I would normally.

## Day Counting Assumptions

- One's work week is Monday - Friday
- One's work day is 8:00am-5:00pm
- One's start day at a new job is the business day immediately following the last day at an old job
